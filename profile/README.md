## Derailed

A prototype, incomplete, in rapid development, social media attempting to combine
all of the best features of Discord, Reddit, and Twitter into one federated and decentralized protocol.

Derailed's main goals are to be:

- Quick, speedy, efficient. Unlike its alternatives.
- Easy, simple, flexible.
- Open, free, secure.
- Moderatable, administrator-first, anti-abusive.
