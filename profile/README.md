## Introduction

Welcome! We're Derailed.
We're a small team of dedicated developers
working on trying to make the best platform ever! 

***Wanna help? Contributing is easy. Really!***

## Contributing

Anything, small or big, is a worthy contribution
in our minds. You took the time to look at our project and say, "hey, why not contribute?"

If you want to contribute we have a bunch of categories for anyone!

Just DM me, or ping me in the Discord to get access to our private repositories.

### Internationalization (i8n)

Of course a big aspect of any project which wants to go worldwide is the language!
Especially, for Derailed it's important for determining aspects and how to do anything.

We'll eventually have a guide for this, and support.

### Coders

#### JavaScript

If you're a JavaScript developer, or fluent with it, you can help us with our app soon!
we're currently hard working with our backend though, so please give us time!

#### Python

If you're a Python developer, you have one of, if not, our most important task at hand.
Our API!

It powers every part of the API and serves as a frontend for the backend.

#### Elixir

Elixir is the technology behind our real-time infrastructure. It's second on every backend poll, and serves as a way
for users to receive messages from our backend in **real-time**.
