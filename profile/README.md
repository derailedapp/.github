## Introduction

Welcome! We're Derailed.
We're a small team of dedicated developers
working on trying to make the best platform ever! 

***Wanna help? Contributing is easy. Really!***

## Contributing

Anything, small or big, is a worthy contribution
in our minds. You took the time to look at our project and say, "hey, why not contribute?"

If you want to contribute we have a bunch of categories for anyone!

Just DM me, or ping me in the Discord to get access to our private repositories.

### Internationalization (i8n)

Of course a big aspect of any project which wants to go worldwide is the language!
Especially, for Derailed it's important for determining aspects and how to do anything.

We'll eventually have a guide for this, and support.

### Coders

#### JavaScript

If you're a JavaScript developer, or fluent with it, you can help us out with our App!

Our app is nonetheless one of the most important parts of our platform, being the place users
interact with the most and use the most. **Where users actually use our other services.**

So if you want to help just [go right here](https://github.com/derailedapp/app) and look at what you can do, or ask on the Discord.

#### Python

If you're a Python developer, you have one of, if not, our most important task at hand.
Our API!

It powers every part of the API and serves as a frontend for the backend.

#### Elixir

Elixir is the technology behind our real-time infrastructure. It's second on every backend poll, and serves as a way
for users to receive messages from our backend in **real-time**.

#### Rust

Rust Developers get to tackle our Authorization Microservice, of which power the entire platform's authorizing.
It's only third since users never access Rust code *currently*.

#### Leveling

In terms of everything, we'd rate the most important being:

- Python - Since it powers our API, the backbone.
- Elixir - Since it powers our real-time event infrastructure, the Gateway.
- Rust - Since it is the backbone of our private Microservice Infrastructure.
- and Javascript - Since it's the main language used on our website, and henceforth the backbone of that and where users mainly come into.
