## Introduction

**WARNING:** Derailed is under heavy development. The platform is still unstable and anything can change for any reason.

A social media where you are the platform. Decentralized social networking, instant messaging, and communities with
the Derailed Protocol (Aurora,) and the soon-to-be released Derailed Client which allows you to use Derailed's entire featureset
with any server that implements Aurora.

## Projects

### Aurora

Aurora is the protocol defining Derailed's features and how its decentralization works.
The official reference implementation is written in Rust and can be found [here](https://github.com/derailedapp/aurora).

### Derailed Client (to be named & publicized)

A universal client for Aurora-implementing servers built in React.
