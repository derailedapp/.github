## Introduction

Welcome to the Derailed GitHub. This is where we share our open works with the incredible open-source community as well as build our great project.

Derailed is a voice+text app focused on customizability, usability, and most of all versatility. It tries to be better than Discord by providing all of these, and more.

Derailed is still a work-in-progress closed-alpha project, so sadly we can't give away too much.

If you wanna join Derailed's closed beta however, you can register [via this form](https://forms.gle/ZjddjtHqZKR45h6e7). The closed beta doesn't have a specified ETA at this time.
