## Introduction

Welcome! We're Discoursy.
We're a small, dedicated, team of developers
working on trying to make the best platform ever! 

***Wanna help? Contributing is easy, really!***

## Contributing

Anything, small or big, is a worthy contribution
in our minds. You took the time to look at our project and say, "hey, why not contribute?"

If you want to contribute we have a bunch of categories for anyone!

### Internationalization (i8n)

Of course a big aspect of any project which wants to go worldwide is the language!
Especially, for Discoursy it's important for determining aspects and how to do anything.

We'll eventually have a guide for this, and support.

### Codebase

If you're a good 'ol developer with at least a bit of Pythob or JavaScript experience, you can help out with our codebase!

For Python developers, our most important aspect.. Our API of course!

And for JavaScript developers our second, or more our equally import aspects.. Our App and Website!

If you want to overlook the codebase, just head to the discoursy/discoursy repository.
